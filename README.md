# Voice2Voice

Voice2Voice is a voice-to-voice translator designed to break language barriers. It can convert your speech to Japanese and play it back using the VoiceVox to generate text-to-speech. Additionally, it utilizes the Assemble AI API for speech-to-text conversion and the fast Google Translate API for translation. This project is useful for people who want to communicate in Japanese without the need for typing or reading.
