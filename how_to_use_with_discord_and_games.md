1. Download [EarTrumpet](https://eartrumpet.app/), [VoiceMeeter banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm)(after you install VoiceMeeter banana you'll also need to restart your PC) and open VoiceVox.
2. For VoiceMeeter banana, we need to change voice output and voice input first.
   1. Open the Control Panel by pressing the `Windows key` and typing `Control Panel`. In the upper right corner, click on `View by` and select `Large icon`.

4. Change your `playback/output device` by clicking on the speaker icon on the taskbar (or go to `window setting` -> `System` -> `Sound` -> `Choose your output device`). Select `VoiceMeeter Aux Input (VB-Audio VoiceMeeter AUX VAIO)` first and then selcet `VoiceMeeter Input (VB-Audio VoiceMeeter VAIO)` (we need to do this process to let Python recognize these playback devices).
